## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

In this project, I built a calculator that sent data from the client side to the server, the server did the mathematical calculations, and then sent the data back again. I have two input fields where a user can input the numbers of their choice, they then choose an operator button, and press equals to get their answer. All of the calculations that they did get stored in a calculation history section. There is also a clear button that resets the input fields. 

I used a post request to send over the initial object of information over to the server, had a function that did the computations on the server side, and then within the post request ran another function that had a get request in it to get the information back from the server and append it to the DOM.
